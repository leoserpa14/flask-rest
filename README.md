Flask REST API again

Originally tried to do a FLASK RESTFUL API, problem is that the migrate function crashed the cmd prompt.
Then I tried with Django, discovered that the problem was not that Flask crashed, but Postgresql crashed. Turns out that the Django tutorial I was following was incomplete, so I decided to start a REST API with Flask again, this time with Sqlite3 as a database.
